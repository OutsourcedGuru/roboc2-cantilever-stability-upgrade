# roboc2-cantilever-stability-upgrade
Step-by-step instructions for upgrading the Robo C2 with cantilever stability for the print bed.

## Overview
The Robo C2 is an awesome printer. Nonetheless, it looks like the print bed is a little precariously cantilever from the back of the printer to the front, allowing a bit too much wiggle room. This appears to be resulting in wobble with tall parts especially when placed at the front of the print bed.

This upgrade hopes to add some stability to the print bed along the Y axis.

## Parts to buy
For this, you'll want eight M3 aluminum shoulder bolts anywhere from about 8mm to 12mm in length. Feel free to also buy eight small lock washers to fit these M3 bolts.

## Part to print
There's a single part to be printed. I'm sure that a carbon fiberâ€”infused filament would be good here but I'm not sure if it merits the cost. It should work just as well with a cheaper PLA filament, I'd guess.

## Installation
The print bed should be removed, the bed adjusted in height for your convenience and the printed part placed under the bed frame. The ribs should be aligned to face you and the flat side should be facing up.

Install three bolts in a line on the left and right and the remaining two bolts are along the center line. Leave all bolts initially loose. Tighten the four remote corners, then all the others.

Test a print of the familiar Benchy or a column at the front of the print bed. In theory, this should add enough stability toward the front that it doesn't vibrate as it did before.
